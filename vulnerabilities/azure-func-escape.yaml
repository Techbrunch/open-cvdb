summary: |
  Azure serverless functions (commonly referred to as Azure Functions) is a serverless compute service that enables users to run
  event-triggered code without having to provision or manage the infrastructure. Being a trigger-based service, it runs code in response to a variety of events. 
  For each function, a new container is generated by the host. Each container will be terminated and deleted after several minutes, 
  to differentiate serverless function from traditional containers as a service.
  Researchers investigated Azure's serverless architecture and were able to break out of the serverless function to the underlying host. 
  They also discovered that the host was a HyperV virtual machine that hosted several other serverless functions.
